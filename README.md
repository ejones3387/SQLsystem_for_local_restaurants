# The Service Industry's Dilemma: Building a modern information system for local restaurants
Connor Vaughs, Elisabeth Jones, Luke Hanselman, Sina Anaraki, Stefany Montano

## Intro
This SQL code creates a SQL environment and implements queries to create practical solutions for local restaurants (In this script we specify a local joint called Chicken Charlies!). This project was completed as part of the final group project for Enterprise Data Management (MIS686) as part of my M.S. in Big Data Analytics at San Diego State University. 

## Technology
* SQL Server 2019
* MySQL 8.0

## Problem Statement
Chicken Charlieâ€™s has the potential to increase profit margins, minimize food waste, and reduce food costs by deploying a database designed to integrate cost-saving menu design and inventory tracking. 

## Queries 

1. Customer places a large catering order for the next day. Junior manager finds inventory lacking in the needed product to complete order.
Only local suppliers can fulfill next day deliveries. Find the contact information of vendors who can do next day deliveries.

2. Charlie wants to run a special this week to get rid of extra inventory. Return a list of the quantity of all products in inventory.

3. Charlie wants to know who locally he is spending the most money buying products from to potentially replace them with a cheaper out of town competitor. Show a list of vendors located in San Diego and list their most expensive order.

4. Charlie wants to know what type of chicken wing has the lowest price right now. Return a list of wings in from the database with average prices.

5. Senior manager notices the first of the month was busy and wants to know how that affected orders for the rest of the week.
Return a list of the daily average price of orders from April 2nd to April 7th.

6. Chef notices there haven't been many orders of blue cheese recently and wonders how often we order it compared to other cheese. Show how long it has been since we last ordered all cheese ingredients.

7. Charlie wants to know what products he has spent the most money on recently. Return a running total of items ordered by ascending order data.

8. Charlie wants to know which ingredients he spends the most on per order on average. List the average cost by ingredient from orders between April 4th and April 8th from highest average cost to lowest average cost.

9. Junior manager is preparing to change inventory taking days and is making a list of ingredients which have been in stock on each day. What is the average quantity in stock on a certain day?

10. Charlie sees a whole table eating a Cowboy Burger and wants to know the food cost of such a creation. Return the total cost of every ingredient required for making a Cowboy Burger.
